== Directory tree


All asciidoc manuals are conserved in the `docs` directory.

IMPORTANT: All directories prefixed with underscore `_` are related 
to jekyll, a static web generator. Avoid mixing asciidoc files with
these directories.

Manual directories are organized by categories as you can see on the main
pages.  For each category of book, there is a directory containing a file
`list/adoc` which list book covers, and a `README.adoc` for displaying this
list.

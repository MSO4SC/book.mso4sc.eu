== Objectives and goals

The main objective of our task is to develop a thermal model for finding the
temperature distribution of different components of an electric motor during
its various operating conditions and to determine the heat removal by natural
convection from the machine surface.

The application allows the predictions of simultaneous heat transfer in solid
and fluid media with energy exchange between them. The prediction of the
temperature distribution inside an operating electric motor is required at the
machine design stage. Excessive temperature in the motor can cause electrical
insulation failure, demagnetization of the magnets and increase in Joule
losses.

As shown in Fig. 1, the electric motor model has a very complicated geometry.
Obviously, it is not possible to perform simulation on the entire PM motor, due
to the large number of volumes and calculations required. Therefore, a part of
the PM motor consisting of each part (front cover, stator core, stator
windings, rotor, permanent magnets, shaft, external housing and the air-gap
between these components are modelled for this study as shown on the Fig. 2.
Fig. 3. shows a detailed view of the main components of the modeled electric
motor.

Model detail includes; (1) the front cover, (2) and (5) the external housing
geometry, (3) the stator core geometry including slot detail and the stator
windings, (4) the rotor geometry including permanent magnets and shaft. In
order to simplify the model, the winding region was modeled as a solid section
and the end winding region was modeled as a torus. This assumption made this
motor element easier to mesh.

As shown in Fig. 4, the mesh for the motor and the air-gap was created based on
tetrahedral elements, as these are the only elements capable of meshing that
domain.

== Thermal modeling

We are interested in solving a conjugate heat transfer problem in a domain Ω
which consists of a set of N sub-domains that represent fluid and solid
regions.

The strategy to solve conjugate heat transfer problems is based on:

* modeling the heat transfer in solid
* modelling flow and heat transfer in the fluid
* the solutions are coupled at the fluid-solid interfaces using the continuity
of temperature and heat-flux.

The fluids (internal and external) are modeled using the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations with the Boussinesq approximation. The solids are
modeled with the heat equation.

The coupling of the fluid domain and the solid domain is accomplished through
the transfer of temperature and heat flux at interfaces.

The Navier-Stokes equations with the Boussinesq approximation are solved to
compute the fluid flow and it can be expressed as:

* The continuity:

Whereis the thermal conductivity, __C__~p~ is the specific heat capacity and is

=== Conjugate heat transfer algorithm:

The algorithm starts with the initialization of the of temperature at the
solid/fluid interfaces.

==== Solving a Dirichlet type problem in fluid domain:

The fluid solver utilizes the wall temperature (solid/fluid interfaces) for the
evaluation of flow and heat transfer in the fluid. This step allows us to
establish the continuity of the temperature at solid/fluid interfaces.

* Based on the results of the previous step the heat flux and the heat transfer
coefficient between solid and fluid parts are determined.

==== Solving a Neumann type problem in the solid domains:*

The computed temperature distribution of fluid and the heat transfer
coefficient are transfered to the heat solid solver and then we solve the
conduction problem in solid domain with a boundary condition on fluxes. This
step allows us to establish the continuity of the heat flux at solid/fluid
interfaces.

This process is repeated until the convergence is achieved.

== HEAT SOURCE MODEL

The heat losses produced in a PM synchronous motors are the results of
different losses (electrical, mechanical, eddy current..). The main heat
sources of the electrical losses which comprise the conduction losses of the
stator windings and the iron losses, including eddy current loss and hysteresis
loss of the stator core.

Thus, one goal of this part is to develop method for calculation of the Joule
heat only using a Finite Element Method and the other types of losses are
neglected. The output results of the loss calculation is used in the thermal
analysis.

=== Electrostatics

The electrical potential field in a conductor is governed by Maxwell’s equation
of conservation of electrical charge.

Steady-state case: the equations can be written as follows:

[stem]
++++
E=-\nabla\phi \quad \text{in} \Omega
++++

The constitutive equation:

[stem]
++++
J= \sigma E \quad \text{in}\Omega
++++

where stem:[E] is electrical field, stem:[\Phi] is the electrical potential,
stem:[\sigma] is the electrical
conductivity, and stem:[\sigma] is the electrical current density vector.

The balance equation expresses conservation of charge (Gauss’ law):

[stem]
++++
\nabla J= 0 \quad \text{in}\Omega
++++


Elimination of the intermediate variables and in yields the scalar Poisson’s equation

[stem]
++++
\nabla(\sigma\nabla\phi)= 0 \quad \text{in}\Omega
++++

The boundary conditions are as follows:

* a prescribed electrical potential: stem:[\phi=\phi_0], on stem:[\Gamma_\phi]
* imposition of an electrical current density: stem:[J_n = -J.n = J_0]

with denoting the local outward unit normal vector.

Using Green's (divergence) theorem, the weak or global form of the Poisson’s
equation is:

[stem]
++++
\int_\Omega\nabla\phi\nabla Vd\Omega - \int_{\partial\Omega}\sigma\nabla\phi nVd\Gamma = 0
++++
,
[stem]
++++
\int_\Omega\nabla\phi\nabla Vd\Omega + \int_{\partial\Omega}(J.n) Vd\Gamma = 0.

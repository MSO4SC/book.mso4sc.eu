== Objectives and goals

Tha main goal is to Develop 3DAirQualityPrediction, an accurate, fast, modular, easy-to-use software framework for urban AQ prediction.

== Main features of the framework

* Modular framework with exchangeable solvers for modules
* Standardized input-output data formats for each module
* Availability in HPC oriented cloud e-infrastructure
* Detailed modelling for AQ prediction at urban scale
* Real 3D geometry
* Vehicular traffic
* CFD for dispersion -> RANS and LES/DNS
* Data integration (e.g. meteorology, vehicular traffic, authorities)
* Validation

=== Preprocessing of the geometrical data: meshing

=== Preprocessing of the geometrical data: parametric CAD and meshing by scripts

* Parametrization of OSPM geometry to 3D CAD geometry
* OSPM street configuration converted to CAD geometry by script using some additional parameters (for the 3D model size)
* CFD compatible mesh generated from CAD geometry

=== Preprocessing of the geometrical data: fitting the traffic geometry to the CFD mesh

Emission source location fit from traffic model to CFD mesh, calculated with in-house Java program
Parametric lanes defined by some measures (distances)
OpenStreetMap and the national road authority’s format

=== The traffic and emission modules

* Traffic is modelled by SUMO based on calibrated historical data or by interpolating measurements from operational road traffic data

* Emission model Copert 4 implemented in Java based on real regional fleet data

=== The meteorology modules

AROME model running by OMSZ (the Hungarian Meteorological Services) for the whole Carpathian basin
Resulting wind fields at different heights for the demonstration area, selected automatically

=== The dispersion simulation

Used models (until now): ANSYS Fluent, OpenFOAM and Parmod
CFD model components:

* 3D RANS k-ε turbulence model with calibrated coefficients
* Humidity
* Parks and groves as porous zones
* Meteorological wind data as inlet boundary condition
* Initialized with wind and temperature profiles
* Polyhedral and hex core meshes, with/without boundary layer resolutions
* Full transient and frozen flow field models

= MADF Tosca design

Each MADFs application follows a specific design. This design
is described in the following sections

* xref:infrastructure:ROOT:orchestrator/tosca/feelpp/README.adoc[Feel++ Tosca design]
* FEniCS blueprint design
* OPM blueprint design
* ZibAffinity blueprint design

NOTE: Remark that the proposed design is not mandatory, but highly recommended since
MADFs developers will respect this design in newer version of their application.

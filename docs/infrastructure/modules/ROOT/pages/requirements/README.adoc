= MSO4SC: e-Infrastructure requirements
CESGA
v0.1 (2018-11-05), <vsande at cesga dot es>
:toc:
:tot:


Requirements describe the desired features and functionality of a product, here the MSO4SC e-infrastructure. A requirement is something that the e-infrastructure must do or a quality that is must have (it is also possible to consider constraints); either the e-infrastructure demands certain functionalities or qualities, or the stakeholders (clients) want that requirement to be part of the e-infrastructure. Requirements are divided into two classes. A *functional requirement* is something that the e-infrastructure must do if it is to be useful within its intended context. *Non-functional requirements* are properties, or qualities, that the e-infrastructure must have. An important example for a non-functional requirement in the context of the intended MSO4SC e-infrastructure with its mathematical application frameworks are performance requirements (how fast, big, accurate, safe, reliable, scalable).

a| *# Id*
 |Cloud-1 a| *Name*
 |Generic application support
a| *Priority*
 |Medium a| *Req. Type*
 |Functional
a| *Description*
 |The infrastructure should provide support to other MADFs and applications not described in the project. This means that it should be flexible and generic enough that it will not stick to a concrete domain or set of tools.
a| *Purpose*
 |For the sustainability of the project the infrastructure should have the availability to provide support to other user communities beyond those which are part of the consortium.
a| *Actors*
 |CESGA, ATOS
a| *Requester*
 |Stakeholders
a| *Validation scenario*
 |New stakeholders will be invited to use the MSO4SC which should be able to run the new simulations. At least one external application will be executed correctly.

a| *Description*
 |The software developed to manage and orchestrate the infrastructure should be portable and capable to manage other infrastructures, not only the ones and the beginning of the project (CESGA & ATOS).
a| *Purpose*
 |Some use cases are very restricted in terms of data confidentiality, so some parts of the software have to run in local clusters of the users. This should be supported.

*# Id*

*Name*
 |Automate applications deployment and execution
a|
*Priority*
 |High a|
*Req. Type*
 |Functional
a|
*Description*
 |The MSO4SC e-Infrastructure will provide a rich GUI in order to submit jobs to HPC systems and tasks to Cloud providers. A process in the background will be responsible to prepare the application, deploy it and run it in the corresponding context (HPC and/or Cloud) without the need of user intervention in the technical aspects.
a|
*Purpose*
 |MSO4SC stakeholders do not need to be aware of the technical details when asking for the execution of an application. Therefore, MSO4SC e-Infrastructure should ease such task by abstracting the technical complexity, with the proper mechanisms running in the background.
a|
*Actors*
 |ATOS, CESGA
a|
*Requester*
 |MSO4SC partners, Stakeholders
a|
*Validation scenario*
 |All the project pilots will evaluate the functionality. Stakeholders will run the applications through a GUI from the MSO Portal, and the right deployment and execution will be done by MSO4SC in 100% of the cases (without any error related to the orchestration mechanism itself).

*# Id*
 |Cloud-9 a|
*Name*
 |Decoupling of simulations and visualization
a|
*Priority*
 |Medium a|
*Req. Type*
 |Non-Functional
a|
*Description*
 |Simulations run in MSO4SC should provide the possibility to use any tool for visualization, instead of a concrete one for all the cases. This means that it will be possible to generate the simulation outcome and just download it if desired, so the stakeholders will be able to select the visualization tool they want and provide such outcome as input. All the MADFs will store simulation outcomes in a location from which the MSO Portal will be able to access to serve it to stakeholders.
a|
*Purpose*
 |MSO4SC stakeholders want to avoid vendor lock-in in the case of visualization, since each one may have their own preferences in term of post-processing and visualization tools.
a|
*Actors*
 |ATOS, CESGA, KTH, BCAM, UNISTRA, SINTEF
a|
*Requester*
 |Stakeholders
a|
*Validation scenario*
 |Several simulations will generate outcomes that can be retrieved directly by stakeholders. Such functionality will be tested separately with all the pilots, checking that in 100% of the cases it is possible to retrieve the simulation result, and use it in the desired visualization tool (after some post-processing, if required).

*Description*
 |The users request a way to pause or stop a simulation in order to reconfigure it and start again, from the beginning or a certain point, from an adequate GUI.
a|
*Purpose*

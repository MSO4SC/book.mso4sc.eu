= Executive Summary

The high level objective of WP5 is to demonstrate and showcase the validity and effectiveness of MSO4SC by defining and implementing a set of pilot scenarios. WP5 will also provide a comprehensive overview of the innovation benefits, the problems that are solved, and how these can link to commercial viability. This document represents deliverable D5.1 that provides a description of the pilot scenarios and an evaluation strategy of the e-infrastructure, in particular with respect to evaluation of the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) that will reach TRL8 as part of the project.

Each MADF has at least one associated pilot, which will demonstrate TRL8 of its associated MADF. A short description of the TRL concept is given, and evaluation criterions are formulated for the pilots based on this concept. We describe the pilots to be implemented, and the features to be evaluated against the TRL criterions, formulated in the form of test cases defined for each pilot. This report will be updated once at a later stage of the project as part of D5.1.

=== Purpose

The high level objective of WP5 is to demonstrate and showcase the validity and effectiveness of MSO4SC by defining and implementing a set of pilot scenarios. WP5 will also provide a comprehensive overview of the innovation benefits, the problems that are solved, and how these link to commercial viability. This goal is decomposed into the following objectives: (i) define and coordinate the design of the pilot scenarios; (ii) provide the implementation of pilot scenarios according to the requirements specified in WP2 and the test cases defined for each pilot; (iii) evaluate MSO4SC by verifying the degree of achievements in fulfilling the requirements defined in WP2, including functional and non-functional aspects, and in the form of a target Technology Readiness Level (TRL). The results of the evaluation will be the input for the revision of the research activities of WP3 and WP4.

[[overview]]
=== Overview

This document provides a description of the pilot scenarios. It also describes the overall evaluation strategy, detailing the protocol and procedures that should be followed during the evaluation of the pilots, in particular with respect to evaluation of the TRL level. The pilots and the evaluation strategy are based on the requirements identified in D2.1[[_Ref353795592]][1], together with direct input from the pilot coordinators and end-users. This is the first D5.1 report, which will be updated once during the project taking into account results and experiences up to that point in the project.

The evaluation plan formulates a set of features for each pilot to be validated and goals to be achieved, in the form of test cases. The results of the evaluation protocol will be reported twice during the project in the form of evaluation reports (D5.4), to function as input to the successive releases of the MSO4SC platform, and to the research community. In line with the evaluation strategy, the pilots have been detailed, specifying end-users, a set of test cases, and how the MSO4SC e-infrastructure will be used, in order to facilitate their implementation in D5.3.

In D2.1 the pilots were divided into four groups: three groups of pilots based on the MSO4SC MADFs: FEniCS, Feel++ and OPM, respectively, and one group of pilots based on other applications. The functional requirements identified in D2.1 of the envisioned infrastructure were: (i) high performance of the applications; (ii) efficient data flow between the application domain and the e-infrastructure; (iii) fast post-processing including visualization. The main non-functional requirement was (iv) usability of services with one-click deployment from the marketplace, which is of particular importance for non-technical users like authorities applying an end-user application from MSO4SC for a certain addressed societal challenge.

[[evaluation-strategy]]
== Evaluation strategy

In this section we describe the evaluation strategy, in the form of an evaluation plan detailing the protocol to be followed during the evaluation of the pilots. The evaluation criteria are formulated to demonstrate the progress to TRL8 of the e-infrastructure as defined in D2.2 [2], in particular the Mathematical Development Frameworks (MADFs) and the MSO Portal. Each MADF has at least one associated pilot, which will demonstrate TRL8 of its associated MADF and the MSO Portal. We start by a short description of the TRL concept, and then describe how we will evaluate the pilots with respect to this concept.

[[technology-readiness-level-trl]]
=== Technology Readiness Level (TRL)

Technology Readiness Level (TRL) is a method to estimate the technology maturity of a component or product during the development process. TRL is based on a scale from 1 to 9, with 9 being the most mature technology. The TRL concept provides a framework that enables consistent and uniform assessment of technical maturity across different technology fields.

Although the TRL scale is conceptually universal, the precise definition of the different levels differs between agencies such as NASA, ESA and EC. We will here adopt the EC definition[[_Ref354734949]][multiblock footnote omitted] of TRL6 to TRL8, outlined in Table 1. All pilots satisfy TRL6 at the start of the project. The main difference between TRL7 and TRL8 is that at TRL8 the pilots have reached a level of maturity that allows the end-users to use the service independently from the developers of the service, and whereas TRL7 verifies the functional requirements identified in D2.1, TRL8 in addition verifies the non-functional requirements.

[[evaluation-plan]]
=== Evaluation plan

To apply the TRL scale to the MADFs, we need to adapt the EC definitions to the context of the pilots that will serve as evaluation criteria for the MADFs.

We outline the MSO4SC interpretation of the TRL criteria in Table 2 for TRL7 and TRL8, and we recall that all MADFs and pilots already satisfy TRL6 at the outset of the project. Pilots are formulated together with end-users of the MSO4SC technology. The TRL operational environment is interpreted as the operational environment of the end-user, with the TRL7 criterion defined as a prototype of the pilot being demonstrated in a test case representative for the end-user environment. The criterion for TRL8 is defined as a service that can be used independently by the end-user through the MSO Portal.

The pilot evaluation protocol is described below, based on the functional and non-functional requirements identified in D2.1.

[[definition-of-pilots]]
== Definition of pilots

In this section we describe the pilots to be implemented in D5.3. The features to be evaluated correspond to the features listed in the development roadmap in D2.2, which will be evaluated in through test cases defined for each pilot. Over the course of the project, the test cases may be modified or new test cases may be added. First, the pilots associated to the three MADFs are defined (FEniCS, Feel++, OPM), and then the remaining pilots.

[[fenics-pilots]]
=== FEniCS pilots

Two pilots are based on the FEniCS MADF, with the common requirements that the pilots together with the FEniCS MADF should be deployed at the MSO4SC e-infrastructure, including support for post-processing and visualization as part of the MSO Portal, e.g. by ParaViewWeb. The input is in the form standard CAD data or an STL surface, whereas the output is a time series of sampled solutions over a tetrahedral volume mesh.

[[floatingwindturbine]]
==== FloatingWindTurbine

*End-user:* Tecnalia.

Over recent years, wind energy has emerged as the most promising source of marine renewable energy. In particular offshore wind has large potential, due to the wind typically being stronger offshore, and the visual and noise impact of the offshore turbines being lower than their onshore counterparts. Offshore floating platforms for wind turbines represent a challenging design concept, seeking to balance cost effectiveness and performance.

The FloatingWindTurbine pilot application is a key driver in the ELKARTEK “ICERMAR” project, which is a collaborative project between BCAM and the end-user Tecnalia on Marine Renewable Energy research, funded by the Basque Government. The task of the pilot is to function as a software tool for virtual design of floating wind turbines.

*The pilot will be evaluated through two test cases*, defined in collaboration with the end-user. The first is a single-phase simulation of water flow past a platform, and the second is a standard benchmark in marine engineering, the MARIN benchmark [3].

*Test Case 1:* The interaction of ocean currents with the semi-submersible Nautilus platform[[_Ref353797743]] [4,5] is modelled. To solve the Navier-Stokes equations describing the ocean flow, FeniCS-HPC [6] is used in the form of the Unicorn CFD solver, which is based on the Direct FEM methodology, including parameter-free implicit turbulence modelling, a cheap slip velocity boundary layer model and adaptive error control [7]. The simulations will be validated against experimental results. In particular, the drag of the platform will be compared with data from a tank test campaign [8,9].

The geometry model is provided by Nautilus Floating Solutions, a Basque spin-off company comprised of industry leaders partnering in research on offshore wind energy. The geometric model describes a floating platform supporting a wind energy turbine; in the form of a 4-column ring pontoon semi-submersible platform with heave plates and a catenary mooring system. The wind turbine is located in the centre relative to the columns. The precise specifications of the geometry are as follows:

* The four columns are 9.5 m diameter each and are placed in a square pattern at a distance of 33 m from one another. The columns are connected by a rigid ring pontoon, which is provided with heave damping plates at the bottom. The horizontal plates at the bottom and in between the columns increase the added mass.
* The operational draft is around 20 m.

The expected size of the computational problem is an unstructured tetrahedral FEM mesh of ca. 10 million vertices.

*Test Case 2:* The pilot will be validated against the MARIN benchmark, a standard benchmark in marine engineering for wave impact, or dam break. The benchmark consists of a door opening, allowing a volume of water to enter which creates a wave that impact the wall in the box (see Figure 2). This test case involves turbulent two-phase flow (air and water), discretized by a Direct FEM method with a variable density formulation [10], using an unstructured tetrahedral mesh of around 2 million vertices, Simulations are validated with experimental data obtained by mounted pressure sensors on the box.

[[dairqualityprediction-cfd]]
==== 3DAirQualityPrediction-CFD

*End-user:* OMSZ (The Hungarian Meteorological Service)

Ambient (outdoor) air pollution is estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be the largest single environmental health risk, each year causing millions of premature deaths worldwide, with strong links to both cardiovascular disease and cancer. The societal challenge of air quality is particularly urgent in urban areas, with traffic as one of the main sources of pollution. The impact of air pollution may be more or less severe depending on the local climate and urban planning. To simulate the dispersion of air pollutants is of major interest, for urban planning and also for local forecasts of the air quality. For example, local hot spots may expose the population for elevated health risks, such as cancer. At the heart of an air quality prediction service is a CFD simulation tool for the local climate system, including dispersion of air pollution.

*The pilot is evaluated in one test case*. In addition this pilot will function as a subroutine for the pilot 3DAirQualityPrediction as the CFD simulation engine.

*Test Case 1:* The test case concerns an urban street canyon for which both simulation results and experimental measurements are available [11]. The problem setup is visualized below.

[[feel-pilots]]
=== Feel++ pilots

The common requirements of the Feel++ pilots are that the pilots should be deployed at the MSO4SC e-infrastructure, including support for post-processing and visualization as part of the MSO Portal, e.g. by ParaViewWeb. The input is in the form standard CAD data or an STL surface, whereas the output is a time series of sampled solutions over a volume mesh.

=== OPM pilots

The requirement of the OPM pilot is that the pilot should be deployed at the MSO4SC infrastructure, with support for parallel MPI and efficient ensemble simulations. The input is in the form standard CAD data or an STL surface, whereas the output is a time series of sampled solutions over a volume mesh.

[[opm-flow]]
==== OPM Flow

*End-user:* Statoil, IRIS, TNO.

OPM Flow is a reservoir simulation application that is part of OPM and has been chosen as the pilot in the MSO4SC project. Reasons for choosing OPM Flow for the pilot include:

* It is the most advanced application in OPM, and is actively developed by the project partner (SINTEF) and other contributors.
* It is the application that generates the most interest from users, including both industry and the research community.

Subsurface flow simulation is of vital importance for the oil and gas industry. This industry depends on reservoir simulation to study petroleum fields, forecast their performance and make investment decisions. Subsurface flow simulations are also important for a wide range of environmental management applications. For example, CO~2~ sequestration studies can inform policymakers and stakeholders about the potential and execution of long-term CO~2~ storage. Studies of groundwater flows and pollutants are other important use cases.

From a mathematical point of view, reservoir simulators solve systems of nonlinear partial differential equations describing the flow of fluids in the porous medium, coupled to models that describe fluid behaviour in wells or facilities that are connected to the reservoir. These systems are often hard to solve for several reasons, for example:

* The porous medium is strongly heterogeneous and anisotropic. In particular permeability can span several orders of magnitude.
* Computational grids usually have high aspect ratios and can be fully unstructured with arbitrary polygonal cells.
* Phase behaviour is nontrivial. For example, phases can appear and disappear as fluid components dissolve or vaporize across gaseous and oleic phases.
* Coupling to wells can connect regions that are far away from each other.
* The models are highly nonlinear.

After discretization in space and time, a complex system of nonlinear discrete equations has to be solved by Newton's method. The Newton approach must be modified to achieve acceptable convergence behaviour.

A successful reservoir simulator must have robust strategies to deal with numerical problems, preconditioning methods that are capable of handling strongly heterogeneous and anisotropic systems, and highly capable linear solvers. From an engineering point of view, it is also essential that the simulator is flexible and powerful with respect to input data, both for reservoir geometry and physical properties, provides robust non-linear and linear solvers with high performance, and support user-friendly reporting and output facilities.

OPM Flow is a fully implicit reservoir simulator for the black-oil fluid model and some extended models. It can run realistic industrial simulation models for petroleum assets and CO2 sequestration cases. The simulator is implemented using automatic differentiation to enable rapid development of new fluid models and features. Since the entire simulator and framework is open source, it is possible for any interested party to build such features and extend the simulator for research or other purposes. It supports industry-standard input and output formats to fit into existing workflows, and its performance is close to the performance of commercial alternatives.

The MSO4SC pilot will allow users to run OPM Flow transparently on HPC or cloud hardware, controlled from a simple web interface. Users must be able to upload their own input data, monitor simulations as they progress and access full results upon completion. From the requirements set out in D2.1, particular emphasis is on the ability to run large ensembles effectively. Three test cases will be used for the evaluation of the pilot.

[[test-case-1-the-norne-field-is-a-norwegian-sea-oil-field-for-which-the-operator-statoil-has-made-available-the-simulation-models-and-other-data-used-on-the-field.-while-not-very-large-in-terms-of-number-of-computational-cells-it-is-complex-in-terms-of-grid-structure-and-fluid-behaviour-features.-the-field-has-many-wells-that-connect-to-the-reservoir-that-must-be-accounted-for.-for-successful-evaluation-we-require-that-the-model-can-be-uploaded-and-run-with-no-further-user-intervention-that-the-results-can-be-accessed-afterwards-and-that-the-results-match-those-obtained-by-a-baseline-simulation.]]
*Test case 1:* The Norne field is a Norwegian Sea oil field for which the operator (Statoil) has made available the simulation models and other data used on the field. While not very large in terms of number of computational cells, it is complex in terms of grid structure and fluid behaviour features. The field has many wells that connect to the reservoir that must be accounted for. For successful evaluation, we require that the model can be uploaded and run with no further user intervention, that the results can be accessed afterwards, and that the results match those obtained by a baseline simulation.

*Test case 2:* The OLYMPIC benchmark is an artificial benchmark created by TNO (Netherlands) for benchmarking ensemble-based reservoir optimization and history matching algorithms, software and workflows. A critical part of such a workflow is the ability to run large ensembles of simulation cases, and that is what will be tested in this scenario. For successful evaluation, we require that a large set of realizations drawn from the case can be uploaded and run in bulk with only minimal user intervention other than setting up the set of ensemble runs, and that results can be accessed in bulk afterwards.

*Test case 3:* The Norwegian Continental Shelf has several aquifers that are considered potential candidates for large-scale storage of CO2. Simulating the injection process and subsequent migration of the CO2 plume is an important part of the suitability evaluation. In this test scenario, we will simulate one of the primary candidates for such sequestration. For successful evaluation, we require that the model can be uploaded and run with no further user intervention, and that results can be accessed afterwards.

[[other-pilots]]
=== Other pilots

[[zibaffinity]]
==== ZibAffinity

*End-user:* Pharmaceutical companies.

The requirement of the pilot is that the pilot should be deployed at the MSO4SC infrastructure, with support for parallel MPI.

ZIBAffinity [15] uses molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and methods of statistical thermodynamics in order to estimate binding affinities for biological host–guest systems (HGS). Having uploaded a small drug-like molecule under observation as input, the user selects one or more protein target structures from a database of force field-parameterized models and submits one job per target-ligand combination to the queue of the CESGA high performance computer. After job processing, the results are made available to the user.

The affinity is estimated as a linear combination of averages of molecular observables according to a linear interaction energy [16] model. Ensuing from the uploaded small molecule, GROMACS MD simulations, with at most 61 different starting positions, are performed in parallel. The optimal binding position (binding mode) is then extracted from that data and provided as a 3D molecular structure serving (Figure 6), along with thermo-statistical data (Figure 6) as the basis for absolute or relative binding affinity estimation.

image:media/image20.png[urface with electrostatic information of a protein in complex with a transformation product of the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole.,width=562,height=199]

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
*Figure 12: Preferential host–guest binding model (left), and conformational entropy (flexibility) during molecular simulation (right).*
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

For each available target molecule separately, the linear combination factors of the free energy equation above must have been learned in advance during a training phase and must be stored in the target database together with the target’s initial configuration and further required information. At runtime, they are used for the calculation of absolute binding affinities (test case 1). If, in contrast, no training data is available for a particular protein target, ZIBAffinity can use standard weights or estimate relative binding affinities (test case 2).

Pilot features to be validated are correct predictions of the binding affinities (inside the statistical range), run-time on the cloud system compared to running ZIBAffinity on HLRN (North-German Supercomputing Alliance), and usability of the data storage and data management concepts of MSO4SC.

*Use Case 1:* ZIBAffinity will be used for a particular test case that is extensively described in a recent article [17]. In this test case several small drug-like molecules are tested against the alpha-estrogen receptor as target molecule. Laboratory data for binding free energies ΔG^Exp^ are available (x-axis in Figure 7) and have been used for parameter estimation regarding the linear interaction model presented above. After that training phase, the ZIBAffinity software predicts binding energies ΔG^Comp^ of all given small molecules (y-axis in Figure 7).

image:media/image21.png[plot-py_lie2011_fit-loo.png,width=392,height=296]

*Figure 12: Predicted vs. experimental binding free energies of the alpha-estrogen receptor and a set of 31 ligands using the software ZIBAffinity.*

With this approach it is possible to estimate the estrogenicity of small-molecules, which is important for prediction of effects of trace pollutants as endocrine disruptors, a major challenge for water cleaning plants [18] and a severe problem of industrialized countries.    

If laboratory data is not available, then ZIBAffinity only provides a priority list of trace pollutants for further biochemical experiments. ZIBAffinity predicts their potential toxicological risk (see Figure 8) on the basis of “adverse” thermo-statistical data.   

image:media/image22.png[ransrisk priority table,width=350,height=152]

*Figure 13: Potential toxicological risk on the basis of “adverse” thermo-statistical data.   *

ZIBAffinity can be used for the prediction of several host-guest-affinities (not only to proteins). One example is the prediction of the elution order of Liquid Chromatographic Separations [19]. This prediction is important for the choice of the column material of separation columns. Thus, it provides important data for the design of chemical processes. A well-suitable column separation material is very important for producing pharmaceuticals with fewer side effects (due to pollutants). In terms of drug delivery, ZIBAffinity can help to design drug-carriers with certain drug-release profiles [20].

*Use Case 2:* ZIBAffinity is used to design small drug-like molecules with a high affinity for special pharmaceutical targets (pain relief drugs [21] or estrogen receptor inhibitors [22]). This test case is important for the planning of the data storage and data management in MSO4SC. The data that is created in these projects is extremely valuable for pharmaceutical companies and, thus, needs a very high level of protection against data loss and data security.

The requirement of the pilots is that the pilots should be deployed at the MSO4SC infrastructure, with statistical data.

*End-user:* OMSZ (The Hungarian Meteorological Service)

Urban citizens are exposed to air pollution at an increased level, which causes many premature deaths [23]. In cities, the main producer of the most relevant pollutants, the nitrogen oxides (NOx) is the traffic, which is responsible for emitting more than 40% of this contaminants. In order to support city authorities and policy makers in their job for reducing air pollution arising from traffic, computational models have been used for running scenarios for some decades. However, accurate models that take into account real 3D geometry of cities including buildings with high spatial resolution and are easy-to-use at the same time seem to be lacking. The main difficulty of matching accuracy and usability is that accuracy needs supercomputers, which is traditionally of difficult use. Bringing the existing 3DAirQualityPrediction framework to the MSO4SC infrastructure and using the fast and accurate FEniCS-HPC application 3DAirQualityPrediction-CFD as module of the framework 3DAirQualityPrediction the project will match accuracy and usability.

The framework is composed of modules, namely traffic, emission, meteorology, dispersion and the core module, which is either for evaluating assessments or performing optimization or control. An overview of the 3DAirQC workflow is seen on Figure 14.

*Preprocessing of the data*

The preprocessing steps of the simulation modules are based on several toolkits consisting of Blender (see https://www.blender.org/) tools for 3D modelling, in-house 3D meshing tools and some commercial tools of ANSYS. All of these steps need normally special and time consuming work, which is done mainly automatically using our tools. For illustration of the tools for geometry preprocessing and meshing see Figure 15 and Figure 16, respectively.

*The traffic module*

For modelling the urban traffic we have been using macroscopic and microscopic models. These are based on

* historical traffic count data of a big campaign and/or
* monitoring data arising from operational data collected by city and national road authorities.

Based on these data, the user has an option to choose PTV VISSIM or VISUM for microscopic or macroscopic simulation of the traffic or either use just statistical or measurement data.

*The emission module*

For modelling the emission of the vehicles in the traffic the European standard emission model, the COPERT model is used. Actually it is a script that computes emissions of the pollutants at street segments that serve as forcing terms in the dispersion module.

*The meteorology module*

For boundary conditions of the dispersion module we used meteorology data from the national official operational data of the Hungarian Meteorology Service (OMSZ), which uses the AROME (Application of Research to Operations at Mesoscale) non-hydrostatic numerical weather prediction model

*The dispersion module*

The project will use 3DAirQualityPrediction-CFD application for simulation of the emitted pollutants. There are two options of running the CFD solver. The first one is the frozen flow field model where the wind field is precomputed with a RANS or an adaptive LES model of 3DAirQuallityPrediction-CFD according to the setting given in a configuration file. Then dispersion of the pollutants is computed with the simple advection-diffusion(-reaction) module of 3DAirQuallityPrediction-CFD. In the second option the wind field and dispersion of the pollutants is computed simultaneously. These options are governed by the configuration of the 3DAirQuallityPrediction-CFD.

*Test cases*

The pilot test cases will be performed in city of Győr where all data including traffic monitoring and also historic data are available.

*Test case 1:* In this pilot traffic and meteorology data are taken from historical data. Thus running the 3DAirQualityPrediction framework all data and codes can be ported and run at the infrastructure of the MSO4SC infrastructure. Several meteorology and traffic scenarios will be run based on - precomputed or statistical – meteorological and traffic data.

*Test case 2:* In this pilot traffic and meteorology data are taken from measurements and, optionally, traffic is simulated. Thus running the 3DAirQualityPrediction framework data transfer from the server collecting measurements data from meteorology and traffic has to be incorporated, Data transfer a dedicated server of SZE that runs the propriety software PTVVISSIM/VISUM will be solved, or alternatively on MSO4SC infrastructure, using the license provided by SZE.

[[conclusions]]
== Conclusions

In this report we have presented the pilots to be evaluated in WP6. We provide a description of the pilot scenarios and an evaluation strategy for the e-infrastructure, in particular with respect to evaluation of the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) that will reach TRL8 as part of the project. The focus is the MSO Portal and the MADFs, where each MADF has at least one associated pilot.
